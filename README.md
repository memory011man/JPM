## ⬤ Overview

This profile is a curated exhibition of work — each repository is a self-contained project card that follows a single visual and structural system.
The aesthetic is fixed and intentional: geometric marks, a single primary accent color, and direct, declarative language.

</p>

Use the `assets/` folder for all marks and poster images:

* `assets/jpm-monogram.svg` (vector source)
* `assets/jpm-monogram.png` (raster fallback, ~200–300px)
* `assets/mark-triangle.svg` / `mark-circle.svg` / `mark-square.svg`
* `assets/poster-1200.png` / `assets/poster-600.png`

---

## ✦ How this works

* Each repo is a poster: `README.md` acts as the visual entry point.
* Visual assets live under `assets/` (no scattered images in root).
* Canonical style and rules live in `docs/STYLEGUIDE.md`.

---

## ▭ Principles (copy this into project READMEs)

* Direct. Nothing extra.
* Design is function.
* Each project stands alone.
